## Ruby

* Ruby is an incredibly powerful language
* Many successful projects/products use it at their core: Ruby on Rails, God, Redmine, etc
* You can add and remove code in a running process, redefine methods on the fly, change their scope
* You can even modify basic types like `String`, `Float` or even `Class` and `Object`
* After using it for a while, you'll notice the lack of flexibility on static languages like C++ or half-static languages like Java

    class Lecture
      def initialize(name = "TBA")
        @name = name
      end
      
      def finish
        "Finished '#{@name}' at #{(Time.now.utc+3600).strftime('%H:%M:%S')}"
      end
    end
