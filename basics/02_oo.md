## It's *really* object-oriented

* In Ruby, all functions and most operators are methods of an object
* In Python, for instance, some functions are procedural
* Classes themselves are instances of `Class`

## It's *really* object-oriented

* Ruby has a permanent notion of the *current object*: `self`
* `self` controls how Ruby accesses intance variables
* All method calls are made on some object, called the *receiver*
* If no *receiver* is specified, `self` is used — it is implicit!
